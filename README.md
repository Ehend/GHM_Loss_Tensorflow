# GHM_Loss_Tensorflow

This is a tensorflow version of GHMC-Loss based on this paper [Gradient Harmonized Single-stage Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05181) and the original pytorch version: https://github.com/libuyu/GHM_Detection.

This code uses the broadcast mechanism for parallel computing for all bins.

### Environment
This code is implemented with 
- Python 3.6
- PyTorch 0.4.1
